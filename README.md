# Introduction
This project is a template for a Barbie themed document report. It has examples for plots and tables, and uses Matthew Jane's ThemePark package for ggplot barbie themed plots. 

### formatting
barbie-theme.scss contains the formatting for the document, with alternatives for background and gemeral text option. Of course the entire .scss is fully customizable as well if you want different things.
